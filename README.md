# libft Library README

Hey there! Welcome to my libft project! This project holds a special place in my heart as it's the first project I worked on in C programming. As part of the 42 Abu Dhabi core curriculum, libft is designed to introduce me to the world of C programming by replicating the basic functionality of the standard C library (libc).

### About the Project:

libft is not just any project; it's a fundamental stepping stone in my journey as a C programmer. By building this library, I aimed to deepen my understanding of essential C concepts and functions while gaining hands-on experience in coding.

### Why libft Matters:

**Foundation Building:** libft has laid a solid foundation for my journey into C programming. By understanding and implementing these fundamental functions, I'm better equipped to tackle more advanced projects.

**Understanding C Internals:** Building these functions from scratch has given me a deeper understanding of how things work under the hood in C programming. This knowledge is invaluable as I progress in my programming journey.
